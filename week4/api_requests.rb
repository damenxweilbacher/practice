# Instructions:
# Pick an API endpoint (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1).
# Create a file api_demo.rb (or any name).
# Require the libraries:
# require 'net/http'
# require 'json'
# Construct a URI and make the request:
# url = URI("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
# response = Net::HTTP.get(url)
# Parse the response:
# data = JSON.parse(response)
# Print some interesting fields:
# puts "Title: #{data['title']}"
# puts "Body:  #{data['body']}"
# Run it:
# ruby api_demo.rb
# Optional: Try another endpoint or parse multiple items. For instance, if the API returns an array, loop over them:
# data.each do |item|
#   puts item['title']
# end
# Challenge:
# If you want them to do something fancier:
# Store the data in a local array, filter for items, or pick a random item.
# Print a nicely formatted message about the data.
# Possible APIs:
# JSONPlaceholder (test posts, users, etc.):
# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
# PokeAPI (Pok√©mon data):
# https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1
# Rick and Morty API:
# https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1
# Or any other small, public API.
